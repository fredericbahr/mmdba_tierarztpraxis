# mmdba_tierarztpraxis

The goal of this university project was to showcase and learn the usage of a multimedia database, specifically PostgreSQL, within a near-real-world context. To achieve this, a system tailored for veterinary practices was developed, allowing for the storage of customer, animal, and medication data. The primary objective was to implement various search techniques, including advanced filtering, full-text search, and image comparisons, to enhance the system's usability and functionality within the veterinary domain. Through this project, students aimed to gain practical experience in database design, implementation, and the utilization of multimedia data in specialized applications.
